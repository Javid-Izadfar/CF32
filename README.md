# CodingFront 32 - README

Welcome to the CodingFront 32 repository! This repository is dedicated to the coding sessions I conduct for my students. Here, you will find code examples, explanations, and resources that correspond to various coding sessions. Each branch in this repository is named after the corresponding session for easy navigation.

## Repository Structure

- **Branches**: Each branch represents a session, named in the format `s<session_number>`, e.g., `s19`, `s20`.
- **Code Examples**: Each branch contains code examples that directly correlate with the topics covered in that session.
- **Explanations**: Alongside the code, you'll find detailed explanations intended to help students understand the concepts being taught.
